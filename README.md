## Assignment Scope

Here is a summar of the minimum requirements specified for this application:

### Feature Requirements

- Application must have the following two pages:

  - **Search** - In this page, the user can search for books via the Google Books API and render them on this page. User should also have the option to "View" a book (by clicking the view button), bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book (by clicking the save button), saving it to the Mongo database.

  - **Saved** - this page should render all books saved into a backend Mongo database. User should also have the option to "View" a book (by clicking the view button), bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book (by clicking on the delete button), removing it from the Mongo database.

- Application should be a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses [`react-router-dom`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express.

### Database Requirements

- Create a MongoDB database named `googlebooks`.

- Use [NPM mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) package to create a `Book` schema.

- The `Book` schema should have the following fields:

  - `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API.
  - `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API.
  - `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API.
  - `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API.
  - `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API.

### Express Route Requirements

- The following Express routes need to be included in the application:

  - `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.
  - `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.
  - `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.
  - `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`.
